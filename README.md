FreeCaptions.org is a web application that generates stylized captions for your videos. The tool runs entirely in your browser—no sign-ups, watermarks or uploads required. Simply load a video, let the built‑in transcription engine generate captions, then customize fonts, colors and layouts before exporting your captioned video.

Because everything happens locally, your files stay private. The editor also lets you download captions in common formats like `.srt` or `.vtt` for use with other video tools.
